<body><h4>1 I. What It's All About</h4>
    <h>2</h>
    <h4>3 Whence come the thousands of photographs used every month by newspapers and magazines?</h4>

<h4>13 At first thought, the answer is, "From professional photographers and publisher-photo-services." But professional photographers do not produce one-third of the photographs used, and publisher-photo-services are supplied by that same large number of camerists that supply publications with most of their prints.</h4>

<h4>19 "The photographer is apt to think that all his ambitions would be realised if only he could journey to foreign shores or to distant corners of our country; or if he could attend the spectacular events that focus the attention of the world now and then. [emphasize] This is a delusion. The real triumph is that of the photographer who utilises the material ready at hand in his own district, be it large or small."[end]</h4>
